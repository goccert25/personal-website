            <b>I want to make a difference.</b> One way I tried doing so was by making a reddit bot, called Lookoutt,
            that
            regularly scanned secondhand websites and notified users on reddit when a listing matching their keywords
            was
            discovered. As a regular hunter of secondhand goods, I realized that manually scrolling through various
            secondhand websites every few hours was tedious and simply not feasible for your average user. The effort to
            find a specific item you wanted on a secondhand market was just not worth it when you could instantly find
            the
            item new on a normal retailer's website.

            As a student in college, I never really understood the value of containers and Docker,
            technology that seemed to pervade every single company that I interned at. It's like when everyone tells
            you: don't eat that, it
            taste like crap. You take their word for it, but you never really understand until you try it and realize -
            oh
            it DOES take like crap.

          I had successfully managed to store Grailed's history of sold listings
          (here if you missed it), but I still had
          a daunting task in front of me. How could I use the historical data to determine what was a
          good deal or not? There were so many factors to consider, such as clothing condition, style, brand, item type,
          and even
          purchase time: an item that is currently hot might not have necessarily been hot a few weeks ago.

          I've always heard the common adage: "one man's trash is another man's treasure". However, anyone that has gone
          online secondhand shopping knows that the usual reality is people think their trash is another man's treasure,
          and are sure to price it as such...
