          <p>In my last blog post I
            wrote about the four pillars of alternative protein technology: cultivated meat, precision
            fermentation, plant based protein, and molecular farming.
          </p>
          <p>
            As I researched more about precision fermentation, I stumbled into its overarching domain of
            <b>synthetic biology</b>, “a field of science that involves redesigning organisms for
            useful purposes by
            engineering them to have new abilities.”

          <p>Ever since I read this fantastic article on cultured meat half a year ago, I’ve been
            absolutely
            hooked on the alternative protein space. The industry is relatively nascent and very complex, with
            few clear beginner friendly resources to guide newcomers into the space. As someone with no
            biology/food science background, I have the unique opportunity to write about my learnings from a
            layman’s perspective. This article will give the reader an overview of the alternative protein
            space, its incredible potential, and some of its problems. I ultimately hope this article increases
            the number of people working in this space, or at minimum increases readers’ willingness to buy
            alternative protein products.</p>

          <p>I&rsquo;ve long believed that the majority of the crypto ecosystem is a scam, and truth be told I still
            believe that. However, in the Work on Climate slack there are similarly crypto-skeptic folks that are sold
            on the regenerative finance
            movement (frequently referred to as ReFi), with many of them referring to Regen Network as a prime example
            of
            a fantastic project. That piqued my curiosity enough to listen to the Regen Network&rsquo;s founder, Gregory
            Landua, interview with the ReFi Podcast. Greg&rsquo;s genuine desire to improve the world, his
            clear track record of having done so, and his conviction in ReFi convinced me to revisit the ReFi movement
            without any prejudices and analyze the movement from first principles.</p>

            <b>If we spend 1/3rd of our waking life working, then why not work
              on something that matters?</b>
            This simple question drove me to reevaluate my career and long
            term vision, convincing me to leave my job at Robinhood and
            dedicate my career to fighting climate change. Finding my next
            role was harder than expected, so I wanted to write down some
            lessons I learned along the way in case they could be helpful for

            What we work on matters, and incremental improvements, no matter
            how small, have compounding effects. I’ve decided to put my
            efforts towards fighting climate change, and to anyone who reads
            this, I hope you will too. The problem is intimidatingly massive,
            but with that size comes incredible opportunities for impact and
            innovation. In this article I hope to summarize what I’ve learned
            so far about the energy industry and the current landscape of
            companies tackling these issues, so anybody like me, a traditional
            software engineer with no background in energy or climate change,
            can get caught up to speed a bit quicker.

            The past two years have been an exciting time for Robinhood engineering as we’ve launched new products to
            millions of customers and scaled our operations to meet the enormous demand. During this rapid growth
            period, we spun up the Load and Fault team to increase product safety and reliability for our customers. In
            this blog post, we’ll be looking at how this team tackles daily load testing and the core principles that
            inform our decision making process.

            I still remember the exact moment in August of 2020. I, a "tech
            lead" just one year out of college, had just received a meeting
            invite to the biweekly software platform tech lead/engineering
            manager meeting. The meeting was filled with Senior and Staff
            engineers that were revolutionizing the computer industry when I
            was still crawling in my diapers.

            <b>I want to make a difference.</b> One way I tried doing so was
            by making a reddit bot, called Lookoutt, that regularly scanned
            secondhand websites and notified users on reddit when a listing
            matching their keywords was discovered. As a regular hunter of
            secondhand goods, I realized that manually scrolling through
            various secondhand websites every few hours was tedious and simply
            not feasible for your average user. The effort to find a specific
            item you wanted on a secondhand market was just not worth it when
            you could instantly find the item new on a normal retailer's
            website.

            As a student in college, I never really understood the value of
            containers and Docker, technology that seemed to pervade every
            single company that I interned at. It's like when everyone tells
            you: don't eat that, it taste like crap. You take their word for
            it, but you never really understand until you try it and realize -
            oh it DOES take like crap.

          I had successfully managed to store Grailed's history of sold
          listings (here if you missed it), but I still had a daunting task in
          front of me. How could I use the historical data to determine what
          was a good deal or not? There were so many factors to consider, such
          as clothing condition, style, brand, item type, and even purchase
          time: an item that is currently hot might not have necessarily been
          hot a few weeks ago.
