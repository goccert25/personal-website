      <h1 class="blog-title">How to fight climate change as a software engineer</h1>
      <div class="blog-date">November 1st, 2021</div>
      <div class="blog-body">
        <p>What we work on matters, and incremental improvements, no matter how small, have compounding effects. I’ve
          decided to put my efforts towards fighting climate change, and to anyone who reads this, I hope you will too.
          The problem is intimidatingly massive, but with that size comes incredible opportunities for impact and
          innovation. In this article I hope to summarize what I’ve learned so far about the energy industry and the
          current landscape of companies tackling these issues, so anybody like me, a traditional software engineer with
          no background in energy or climate change, can get caught up to speed a bit quicker.&nbsp;</p>
        <h2 class="blog-heading">Why the energy industry?</h2>
        <p><a target="_blank" href="https://ourworldindata.org/emissions-by-sector" rel="noopener"
            data-mce-href="https://ourworldindata.org/emissions-by-sector">Our World in Data</a> provides a breakdown
          of
          the GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions by sector for 2016:</p>
        <div class="blog-photo-container">
          <img src="Emissions-by-sector-–-pie-charts.png" class="blog-photo" />
        </div>
        <p>At first glance of the pie chart, energy comprises a wooping 73.2% of the world’s GHG emissions. The other
          26.8% of the world’s GHG emissions comes from Agriculture, Forestry, Land Use, Waste, and Direct Industrial
          Processes. This 26.8% slice of the pie is definitely crucial in getting to net zero GHG emissions (<a
            target="_blank" href="https://www.breakthroughenergy.org/our-challenge/five-questions" rel="noopener"
            data-mce-href="https://www.breakthroughenergy.org/our-challenge/five-questions">Bill Gates always asks
            “What’s
            your plan for cement?”</a>) but as someone with a Software Engineering background, it’s tough for me to
          find
          ways to contribute to reducing the size of that slice. Innovations in manufacturing, material engineering,
          and
          chemical engineering seem to be key towards reducing that slice’s emissions, all of which I don’t have a
          background in (if I’m wrong, please correct me and point out opportunities for me to contribute, I would
          love
          to
          hear about them). However, the 73.2% of energy is ripe for innovation, with problems that can be tackled by
          software engineers who are patient enough to learn a bit about the energy industry.</p>
        <p>One of the main ways that the entire 73.2% can be converted to 0% is by electrifying all of the various
          sectors
          of the “energy” slice and powering them with clean electricity. The transport sector is currently being
          electrified with electric vehicle sales growing at exponential rates. Buildings are already mostly
          electrified,
          but they are mostly powered by dirty electricity (electricity generated by power plants that emit GHGs).
          Fugitive emissions from energy production will naturally go down and shrink to zero as reliance on dirty
          electricity shrinks and electrification increases. If we guesstimate that a quarter of GHGs emitted by
          industry
          usage of energy is due to dirty electricity, in total we have 45.5% of total GHG emissions that can be
          mitigated
          via electrification powered by clean electricity (17.5% from buildings, 16.2% from transport, 5.8% from
          fugitive
          emissions from energy production, ~6% from energy use in industry).</p>
        <p>A software engineer interested in contributing to this effort can dive into companies that are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Accelerating the electrification of fossil fuel powered devices</li>
          <li>Increasing the amount of clean electricity produced</li>
          <li>Improving the electrical infrastructure that brings clean electricity to electrical devices</li>
        </ul>
        <p>(Note, this is <em>definitely</em> not an exhaustive list)</p>
        <h2 class="blog-heading">Accelerating the electrification of fossil fuel powered devices</h2>
        <p>Many companies have already contributed significantly to this effort. Electrical vehicle sales are
          currently
          booming right now, with <a target="_blank"

            data-mce-href="https://www.power-technology.com/news/electric-vehicle-sales-surge-in-2021/">sales
            increasing
            by 160% in the first half of 2021 from a year earlier</a>. Tesla, Rivian, and Nio are just a few companies
          producing electrical vehicles in this space, as well as many other upstream companies producing batteries
          (<a target="_blank" href="https://one.ai/" rel="noopener" data-mce-href="https://one.ai/">ONE</a>) and
          electrical

          “CarFax”
          for electric vehicles, tackling a used electrical vehicle market that has been neglected.</p>

          industrial machinery, some startups such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.monarchtractor.com/"

        <h2 class="blog-heading">Increasing the amount of clean electricity produced</h2>
        <p>Electrification won’t amount to much if the electricity being used to power devices is still generated by
          fossil fuel generators and power plants. While the growth rate of renewable energy necessary to avoid major
          climate change disasters is up for debate, it’s universally agreed upon that it <em>needs to significantly
            increase</em> no matter what model is used.&nbsp;</p>

          from ~6200 quadrillion British Thermal Units to 9050 quadrillion British Thermal Units. To go from the 2020
          solar and wind energy production amount (10% of 6200 quadrillion British Thermal Units) to the 2050 solar
          and
          wind energy production amount (80% of 9050 quadrillion British Thermal Units), we would need to increase
          solar
          and wind energy production by 6620 quadrillion British Thermal Units.</p>
        <p>There are many clean energy companies out there, some focused on increasing adoption of clean energy
          sources
          and others focused on innovating on the actual clean energy generation technology itself.</p>
        <p>Tesla is an obvious leader in the space, with its Tesla battery pack and Tesla solar panels. Tesla <a

        <p>Much of the projected growth in demand for energy will come from countries that are currently undergoing
          industrialization. As a result, companies that focus on introducing green technologies in these countries
          have
          the potential to be particularly impactful. <a target="_blank" href="https://shyftpower.com/" rel="noopener"

        <h2 class="blog-heading">Improving the electrical infrastructure that brings clean electricity to electrical
          devices</h2>
        <p>Increasing clean electricity production and electrification won’t amount to much if our electrical
          infrastructure is unable to support increased demand for power as well as the variable energy production
          that
          renewable energy introduces. The United States’ electrical grid is still in the process of modernization,
          with
          utilities <em>just</em> pushing out smart meters that measure energy used by a household. The current
          reality
          is
          the electrical grid was built hundreds of years ago on the basis of a unidirectional flow of power (from
          power
          plants to homes). Currently, with the growth of “behind the meter” distributed energy resources, such as
          solar
          panels, sending energy back into the grid, utilities are struggling to maintain reliability and consistency,
          as
          the premise of unidirectional power no longer holds. In addition, the temporal nature of renewable energy
          sources like solar messes with the supply and demand of energy production, with peak energy production
          occurring
          hours before humans’ peak demand for energy at night.</p>

        <p>As mentioned in the beginning of the article, small steps can have compounding effects. The previous
          section
          covered various startups/companies that need software engineers to successfully execute their mission.
          However,
          starting a job at a new company is a very large step for many people, and simply isn’t feasible due to
          justifiable reasons such as salary differences, location, risk tolerance, or simply because you already
          really
          love your current job. For engineers looking for smaller ways to contribute, open source is a great option.
