      <h1 class="blog-title">Tech Lead - Round 2</h1>
      <div class="blog-date">October 3rd, 2024</div>
      <div class="blog-body">
        <p>
          I started working at <a href="https://terradot.earth/">Terradot</a> as a Tech Lead at the end of February 2024. I recently passed my 
          half year mark, although it has felt far longer. Now feels like a good time
          to reflect on everything I've learned so far, engineering related and otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
          This hasn't been <a href="../reflections_after_one_year_of_tech_leading/index.html">my first rodeo with tech leading</a>, but I'd be lying if I said I had
          it all figured out. Here are some loosely organized thoughts composed of new learnings as well as affirmations
          of previous convictions.
        </p>
        <h2 class="blog-heading">Default to the more popular technology</h2>
        <p>
          It's fun to use shiny new technology. However, engineering decisions shouldn't be made based on what's fun.
          Especially when the fun becomes un-fun once you realize you've run into a bug, are on a tight
          deadline, there's no resources/posts/forums about the issue online, and you're on your own.
        </p>
        <p>
          Especially at a startup with limited resources, defaulting to the technology that is more popular (unless there
          is a good reason otherwise) is extremely valuable. The amount of velocity you can achieve by leveraging open
          source tooling, the existing ecosystem, and now AI tooling (which will be more accurate the more
          popular the ecosystem is due to increased training data) is incredible. Additionally, hiring additional engineers
          and onboarding is made significantly easier with a larger talent pool.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the first hard decisions I faced as a Tech Lead was whether we should stick with the existing tech
          stack (Go gRPC web backend and CockroachDB database). The codebase was still new and small enough that
          moving to a new backend and database was still feasible. I pushed to move to Python (the entire team was more
          proficient in it) and PostgreSQL (we worked heavily with Geographic Information System (GIS) data
          and PostgreSQL with PostGIS was the most popular open source option) and the rest of the team agreed.
        </p>

          <div class='blog-photo-caption'>You gotta admit, the logo is pretty cute
          </div>
      </div>
        <p>
          Even while transitioning though I was second guessing myself - I've heard plenty of horror stories of wasteful
          tech stack migrations and we were using valuable time that could be used for feature development. In hindsight,
          it was obvious we made the right decision. Team velocity shot up and everyone we hired/contracted knew
          Python and was productive on day one. Additionally, since we moved from CockroachDB to PostgreSQL with 
          PostGIS, we immediately gained access to a whole host of GIS focused SAAS companies and open source
          software that supported PostgreSQL with PostGIS out of the box.
        </p>
        <h2 class="blog-heading">A teammate is a teammate regardless of their employment status/tenure/situation</h2>
        <p>
          As a leader on my team, I always try to have a baseline understanding of how my teammates operate and make
          sure to maintain a bidirectional open channel of feedback. At a minimum, I try to understand how they like to
          work, how they would like to receive feedback, what they enjoy working on, and what their long term goals are
          so I can try to maximize the alignment between work that needs to get done and people doing the work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Terradot was my first time working with such a diverse setup of coworkers (part timers, contractors, interns,
          full timers, etc). Many months in I realized that the understanding I try to maintain of my teammates
          didn't encompass the contractors and part timers on the team, and that I wasn't treating them like teammates
          even though they were core members contributing to our team and company success. I immediately changed my
          behavior, added them as optional participants in all meetings and technical discussions, and scheduled
          1 on 1's to improve my understanding of how they like to work. I saw a marked increase in team camaraderie and
          one of the contractors even personally thanked me. I fiercely regret not realizing my mistake earlier. If
          someone is on your team, <b>they're on your team</b>.
        </p>
        <h2 class="blog-heading">Hire Senior Engineers first, Juniors later</h2>
        <p>
          In the past, managing headcount and hiring have always been someone else's responsibility. At Terradot is the
          first time I've been expected to answer "what kind of problems are we going to have on the technical side and
          who do we hire to solve that"?
        </p>
        <p>
          It's not a revolutionary realization, but after working with people with all types of experience, I've
          realized that as new systems are developing, the earlier you hire a senior engineer the more return on
          investment you get. With experience, they're able to make technical decisions that navigate around pitfalls they've
          seen in the past. They're super useful at setting up the initial guardrails and
          patterns. Once those are established, junior engineers can be hired to work in a safer system that
          points them in the right direction.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the same time it's important to hire the right senior engineer. One who understands that context is
          everything, and that just because they've seen a system work a certain way in the past doesn't mean that's how
          the system should work now.
        </p>

        <h2 class="blog-heading">The larger your team, the less IC work you do</h2>
        <p>
          As your team grows (or shrinks) the amount of independent contributor (IC) work you do changes and that's ok! I suspect that everyone
          who has held the role of "Tech Lead" has at one point felt the nagging sensation that they're not coding
          enough because they're too busy helping the team. Frankly, even as I write this observation and reassure you
          that a reduction in individual IC output is ok if your team is growing, I know for a fact that I'll have this feeling again in the
          future. Hopefully writing it down this time will keep that sensation at bay.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note also that eliminating IC work completely is also dangerous as a Tech Lead. It's important to keep a pulse on the
          day to day experience of writing code on your team or else you may not be able to truly appreciate and
          prioritize pain points.
        </p>
        <h2 class="blog-heading">Pinpoint SPOFs on the team and actively work to mitigate them</h2>
        <p>
          Single points of failure (SPOF) on a team regularly occurs when there's a part of your engineering
          system that only a single person has worked on and understands. If that one person were to go on
          vacation, quit the company, or even worse, <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">get hit by a bus</a>, then the
          team/company is screwed. One of your jobs as a tech lead (or really leader in general) is identifying and
          removing these SPOFs through various techniques like always having a buddy on projects,
          emphasizing documentation, rewarding knowledge spreading, and assigning small tasks in a system to someone
          unfamiliar with the system. At Terradot I've been consciously trying to spread mobile app development
          knowledge across more members of the team so our poor mobile app specialist doesn't have to handle every
          single mobile problem.
        </p>
        <h2 class="blog-heading">Don't forget to walk your dog!</h2>
        <p>
          Leading in general can be a lot of work. Don't forget the most important things in life.
