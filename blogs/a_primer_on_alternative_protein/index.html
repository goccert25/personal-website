            <div class="blog-date">August 12th, 2023</div>
            <div class="blog-body">
                <p>Ever since I read <a href="https://www.climaticthoughts.com/p/beyond-beyond-meat" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener">this fantastic article on cultured meat</a> half a year ago, I’ve been
                    absolutely
                    hooked on the alternative protein space. The industry is relatively nascent and very complex, with
                    few clear beginner friendly resources to guide newcomers into the space. As someone with no
                    biology/food science background, I have the unique opportunity to write about my learnings from a
                    layman’s perspective. This article will give the reader an overview of the alternative protein
                    space, its incredible potential, and some of its problems. I ultimately hope this article increases
                    the number of people working in this space, or at minimum increases readers’ willingness to buy
                    alternative protein products.</p>

                <p>The Good Food Institute has a <a href="https://gfi.org/defining-alternative-protein/" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener">great definition</a> for alternative protein:</p>
                <p>
                    <i>“Alternative proteins are proteins produced from plants or animal cells, or by way of
                        fermentation.
                        These innovative foods are designed to taste the same as or better than conventional animal
                        products
                        while costing the same or less.”</i>
                </p>
                <div class="optional-content">
                    <h3 class='blog-heading-2'>What exactly is protein?</h3>
                    <p> Proteins are microscopic workers that perform major functions
                        throughout an organism. In humans they perform essential jobs like helping your muscles move,
                        carrying messages in your brain, and helping your body fight off germs. All proteins are
                        composed of combinations of 20 building blocks known as amino acids. The human digestive system
                        takes protein from food and breaks it down into amino acids, which are then used to build
                        functional proteins for the body.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Humans typically get a lot of their protein from conventional meat products - a fact that the
                        alternative protein industry hopes to change.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Alternative protein comes from multiple different technological sources (listed in order from most
                    mature to least mature):
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Plant based</b> - As the name suggests, this category encompasses protein derived from plants.
                    This
                    technology is what your average consumer is most familiar with and is what supplies the protein for
                    many of the imitation meat products in supermarkets at the moment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Precision fermentation</b> - A less publicly known technology, but one that has been well
                    established in
                    the pharma/chemical production space for many decades. Precision fermentation is commonly compared
                    to beer production. Yeast cells used to make beer have instructions in their DNA that give them the
                    power to produce alcohol from sugar. Modern biotechnology has given us the ability to insert
                    instructions for all kinds of different molecules into the DNA of microbes. With precision
                    fermentation, instructions for specific proteins (like animal protein!) are inserted into a specific
                    microbe. The microbe is then fed nutrients so the microbe is able to duplicate while producing the
                    protein of interest. There are a <a

                        target="_blank" rel="noopener">few other types of fermentation</a>, but precision fermentation
                    is the
                    "hottest" fermentation technology in the alternative protein space at the moment.

                    <b>Cultured meat</b> - Also referred to in media as cell based meat, lab grown meat, or cultivated
                    meat.
                    The process of growing cultured meat involves taking cells from an animal, placing the cells in
                    a container that provides all of the proper nutrients that an animal’s body usually would, and allowing
                    the cell to naturally grow and duplicate. With one animal cell, one could theoretically grow
                    infinite amounts of meat to feed the human population. While the technology is still relatively new
                    and cost of production is much too high for your average consumer, the promise of producing real
                    meat without all the negative externalities is worth pursuing. The US has recently made major progress,
                    with the first cultured chicken meat sold at two fine dining establishments, one in <a

                    <b>Molecular farming</b> - The newest kid on the block. Molecular farming can be thought of as a
                    combination of plant based and precision fermentation. Instead of inserting the instructions for a
                    specific protein into a microbe, the instructions are inserted into a plant. The plant is then grown
                    like any other crop and is later processed to extract the protein of interest. This new approach has
                    the potential to be less capital intensive when compared to other techniques, and has the advantage
                    of existing downstream processes and infrastructure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is important to note that products created from alternative proteins don’t wholly come from one
                    of
                    the aforementioned technology sources. End products for consumers can contain protein created from
                    multiple different technologies. For example, Impossible Foods uses soy protein derived from
                    soybeans, but also has a “heme” protein produced from precision fermentation. Some alt protein
                    companies are currently developing hybrid products that blend plant based protein and cultured
                    animal fat.

                <h2 class='blog-heading'>The impact of expanding alternative protein</h2>
                <p>Expanding the alternative protein space has all sorts of beneficial impacts, some obvious and some

                <p><b>Reducing animal factory farming</b> - The most obvious benefit. More people eating alternative

                    However, due to the heavy usage of antibiotics, the viruses and bacteria that are able to survive
                    and evolve in that environment become “superbugs” that are resistant to antibiotics. These superbugs

                    <b>Evolving science</b> - This is less the case for plant based protein, but for other technologies
                    there
                    is an incredible amount of science that is still actively being developed, with little preexisting
                    public research to work off of. This means risky, expensive, and time consuming amounts of R&D for
                    new companies, as well as a lack of a clear state of the art. Without an obvious optimal
                    manufacturing process, it will be difficult for entrepreneurs to create B2B companies in the space
                    to help products move down the cost curve. Just last year New Age Meats, one of the earliest
                    companies in the cultured meat space, <a

                        target="_blank" rel="noopener">shut down due to its inability to move from the R&D phase to
                        the production phase.</a>

                <p>
                    <b>Difficulty with funding</b> - Overall venture capital funding in the space has slowed from
                    <a href="https://gfi.org/press/new-state-of-the-industry-reports-highlight-transformative-potential-of-alternative-proteins/"
                        target="_blank" rel="noopener">5.1 billion in 2021 to 2.9 billion in 2022</a>.
                    Most of this slowdown can be attributed to the overall macroeconomic
                    slow down, as investor interest in the space relative to other spaces still seems quite healthy, but
                    a reduction in investment still hurts the space. In addition, the current international investment
                    of 1 billion dollars a year is far from the estimated 10 billion dollars per year needed to fuel the
                    industry <a href="https://gfi.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/State-of-Global-Policy-Report_2022.pdf"

                <p>
                    <b>Cost</b> - Most plant based products still have a premium over meat products. Cultured meat is still
                    far too expensive for consumers and plant based products like Impossible Meat are more expensive than
                    ground beef at the grocery store. To make an impact, upstream ingredient costs need to come down,
                    economies of scale need to be achieved, bioprocesses need to be optimized, and more.

                <p>
                    <b>Organoleptic (taste and sensory) properties</b> - While there are many meat alternatives out
                    there at
                    the moment, most of them are still lacking in taste and sensory qualities when compared to
                    traditional meat. <a
                        href="https://www.foodnavigator.com/News/Promotional-Features/Taste-texture-and-nutritional-attributes-of-alternative-protein-products"
                        target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Research shows that key attributes such as taste, texture and a
                        perceived ‘lack
                        of naturalness’ are barriers to purchasing plant-based meats. Of those surveyed, 42% said
                        plant-based meats simply don’t taste as good, with almost a third (32%) saying they don’t find
                        plant-based meats appealing.”</a>
                    As food industry vet, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kerenkles/?originalSubdomain=il"
                        target="_blank" rel="noopener">Keren Kles</a>, states, “previously alt protein was ready to eat,
                    but we’re now
                    evolving the product to be ready to cook. As a result, alternative protein companies are currently
                    challenged with the task of providing a raw product that behaves as one would expect on the pan, and
                    tastes as one would expect after a variety of ways of cooking.”

                <p>Ultimately this article only scratches the surface of the industry and hopefully leaves you with a
                    greater understanding of the vast potential of the space as well as the large obstacles that need to
                    be overcome. If you’d like to dig in further, some resources I’ve personally found very helpful are:
