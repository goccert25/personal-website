                    using clickbait phrases like “revolutionize the space” or “breakthrough technology”, but I think
                    this company and cell free biomanufacturing as a space are definitely worth keeping an eye on.
                </p>
                <h2 class="blog-heading">What is cell free biomanufacturing?</h2>
                <p>To understand cell free biomanufacturing, it’s necessary to first understand the fundamentals of
                    cell based biomanufacturing: ingredients flow into a cell, and your desired output flows out of
                    the cell (in reality it sometimes stays in the cell but that’s not important for this
                    explanation). Inside the cell, a whole class of proteins known as enzymes act as machines in an
                    assembly line. Enzyme number one in the assembly line could chop the input in half, enzyme
                    number two could add an oxygen molecule, etc. The inputs enter the assembly line and exit the
                    assembly line as your desired output.</p>
                <p>Cell free biomanufacturing takes the entire assembly line and pulls it out of the cell.
                    Scientists design a carefully engineered system where the starting input is transformed step by
                    step by the enzymes, only this time in a controlled extracellular environment.</p>

                <h2 class="blog-heading">Pros and cons</h2>
                <p>Like all things, choosing between cell based biomanufacturing and cell free biomanufacturing is a
                    trade off.</p>
                <p>Pros of cell free biomanufacturing:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Higher yield: Cells need to expend resources to grow and duplicate. This means a lot of the
                        food and nutrients you feed cells are not being used to produce your product. In contrast,
                        in cell free biomanufacturing there is nothing to keep alive. All of the inputs are used to
                        produce output, giving you higher yield and less waste.</li>
                    <li>Lower energy usage: Maintaining many of the requirements for cells to happily function, such
                        as steady temperature and oxygen levels, is energy intensive. Similar to the previous bullet
                        point, there’s nothing to keep alive in cell free biomanufacturing so less energy is
                        required.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <div class='blog-photo-container'>

                        company. It still succinctly sums up the benefits despite potential bias.
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>Cons of cell-free biomanufacturing:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cost: Enzymes are expensive to produce in large quantities. Additionally, many enzymes have
                        fairly short effective life spans and can denature (no longer function) if not held in
                        carefully controlled environments. Creating a cell free process to produce your product can
                        be economically infeasible, as it ultimately comes down to how much your product sells for.
                        <br>
                        There’s not a lot of public literature on this, but <a target="_blank"
                            href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9995162/"><span
                                style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);">“an evaluation from 2016…showed that cellulase enzymes
                                used for lignocellulose hydrolysis can account for up to 48% of the minimum selling
                                price of bioethanol, based on a price of around $23/kg as seen in industrial cellulose
                                markets at the time”</span></a>
                    </li>
                    <li>Complicated assembly lines: Sometimes, the enzyme assembly line relies on machinery (such as
                        cofactors or organelles) that is impossible or prohibitively expensive to replicate outside
                        of a cell. Other times, the assembly line could be so long and complicated that pulling it
                        out of the cell and creating an engineered system around the assembly line would be more
                        complex than leaving it in the cell.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 class="blog-heading">Enzyme immobilization</h2>
                <p>How do current cell free biomanufacturing companies typically mitigate these downsides? <a
                        target="_blank" href="https://solugen.com/"><span
                            style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);">Solugen</span></a>’s secret sauce is controlling their
                    own enzyme supply chain. According to <a target="_blank"
                        href="https://polymerist.substack.com/p/the-chemical-company-of-the-future?s=w"><span
                            style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);">this article</span></a>, instead of purchasing directly
                    from enzyme providers, they genetically modify cells to specialize in producing as many enzymes
                    as possible to cut down on and control costs.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Other companies either create products that are still profitable with the high cost of enzymes,
                    or use technology to reduce the cost of enzymes. One such technology is enzyme immobilization,
                    where the enzyme is attached to a support structure in order to improve stability, performance,
                    or both. This is usually beneficial in multiple ways–an immobilized enzyme generally can be
                    reused more often than free floating enzymes, letting you create more final product on a per
                    enzyme basis. An immobilized enzyme is also typically more resilient to rough environments that
                    are common in industrial settings, like non-neutral pH levels and high temperatures.</p>
                <p>Here’s a high level overview of the main types of enzyme immobilization:</p>

                </div>

                <h3 class="blog-heading-2">Adsorption</h3>
                <p>Adsorption is when a particle attaches to the surface of a support structure (as opposed to
                    absorption, where the particles are absorbed into the support structure). Typically, the support
                    structure is made of a specific material that enzymes are attracted to via weaker chemical
                    bonding forces, like hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, and ionic interactions. Adsorption
                    is commonly used in industry and low cost compared to other methods. However, the weaker bond
                    means enzymes have a high likelihood of detaching from the support structure under <a
                        target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4434042/"><span
                            style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);">“industrial conditions of high reactant and product
                            concentrations and high ionic strength”</span></a>.</p>
                <h3 class="blog-heading-2">Covalent binding</h3>
                <p>Covalent binding is similar to adsorption, but uses stronger covalent bonds to bind the enzyme to
                    the support structure. A stronger bond ensures that the enzyme stays attached to the support
                    structure in more intense industrial conditions, such as higher temperatures and extreme pH
                    levels. However, covalent binding <a target="_blank"

                            style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);">“immobilization with significant activity retention and
                            stability requires an empirical, trial-and-error to identify support surfaces,
                            chemistries of attachment, and solution conditions for successful
                            immobilization”</span></a>.</p>
                <h3 class="blog-heading-2">Entrapment</h3>
                <p>Instead of using chemical bonds to attach the enzyme to the support structure, entrapment uses a
                    physical structure to hold and contain the enzyme. This technique is less widely used, as the
                    physical structure containing the enzyme also acts as a barrier to inputs that need to react
                    with the enzyme. Usually this reduces the rate at which enzymes can catalyze reactions,
                    impacting the company’s bottom line.</p>
                <h2 class="blog-heading">Back to Cascade Biocatalysts</h2>
                <p>Cascade Biocatalysts uses a novel covalent binding technology developed by their founding CSO,
                    Dr. James S. Weltz. They’ve found a material–polymer brushes–that can be configured on a per
                    enzyme basis such that it drastically improves the stability, performance, and reusability of
                    the enzyme. As CEO Alex Rosay describes, the technology consists of highly porous beads:</p>
                <p>“Think of it like swiss cheese, and on the edges of the cheese we grow our technology. We grow
                    this body armor…it basically looks like noodles. These noodles surround these enzymes in a way
                    that keeps them very stable and active." (relevant section at around 27:40 in <a target="_blank"

                        href="https://scholar.colorado.edu/downloads/8w32r6736"><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);">
                            paper</span></a> on the company’s foundational
                    technology:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><i>The chemistry of the polymer brush significantly impacts how much the properties of the
                            specific target enzyme improve.</i> In <a target="_blank"
                            href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/51-cell-free-problem-free-enzyme-alchemy-with-alex/id1652738714?i=1000635172579"><span
                                style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);">this podcast</span></a>, Alex specifically mentions
                        how once they’re given an enzyme to stabilize, they can quickly iterate on their “Body
                        Armor” to best suit the enzyme. Based on the paper, this may involve iterating on the
                        chemical composition of the polymer brushes to find one that best suits the given enzyme.
                    </li>
                    <li><i>Enzyme attachment to the polymer brush improved baseline productivity.</i> The enzymes
                        studied
                        had an amphiphilic “lid” that blocked the active site (main location on the enzyme where
                        reactions take place), and attachment to a polymer brush moved the lid, unblocking the
                        active site. This enabled increased productivity regardless of what temperature the
                        productivity comparison took place at. The paper does not state whether this finding
                        generalizes to all enzymes.</li>
                    <li><i>Immobilized enzymes have higher optimum operating temperature points (temperature at which
                            they are most productive), and the productivity at those points is many multiples more than
                            the soluble enzyme (enzyme free floating in water).</i> Increasing temperature is usually a
                        surefire way to increase rates of reaction, which improves processing speeds and leads to
                        cost reduction. My intuition for this is that temperature is the average kinetic energy in a
                        system. Higher temperature means that molecules move faster and bump into the enzymes more,
                        leading to more reactions.</li>
                    <li><i>Immobilized enzymes have a higher stability to more hostile environments (harsh chemicals,
                            high temperature, etc).</i> At 8 M urea (a solution of urea in water typically used to force
                        enzymes to lose their function), one of the studied enzymes attached to a polymer brush
                        retained its structure and continued functioning.</li>

                        that are already used to support traditional metal catalysts. Our goal is to make it as easy
                        to be dropped in existing capex as possible. One thing to note, while I use the language
                        "cell-free" these are "biocatalysis" systems that have been around for decades. Look into

                <p>Alex’s response: “<span style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);">Prices in this industry are usually pretty
                        opaque, so we do not yet have those head to head comparisons with direct competitors. But
                        we'll come in a little higher than traditional players like Purolite with significantly
                        higher performance. Free floating enzymes can go anywhere from $10 per kg for industrial
                        grade lipases to millions of dollars per kg for food grade growth factors and other complex
                        proteins, but even for cheap lipases, you see them typically immobilized in industry thanks
                        to benefits of reuse, move to continuous flows and simplified downstream processing (e.g.,
                        don't have to filter out the enzyme from the end product).”</span></p>
                <p><em>What does the scale up process look like? How do you mass produce these polymer brushes?</em>
                </p>
                <p>Alex’s response: “That's what is keeping us busy today :) We have 1000x'd our scale this year as
                    we are now manufacturing kilograms. We hope to make it to tons in the near future and based on
                    current estimates, should be a pretty straightforward process.”</p>
                <h2 class="blog-heading">Implications</h2>
                <p>This new technology can improve the economics of products derived from cell free biomanufacturing
                    and allow these products to compete with fossil fuel derived analogues. Existing industrial
                    enzyme users, such as <a target="_blank" href="https://solugen.com/"><span

                    could see their cost of production go down, increasing profits and allowing them to spread
