        <h1 class="blog-title">Reflections after one year of Tech Leading</h1>
        <div class="blog-date">August 25th, 2021</div>
        <div class="blog-body">
          <p>
            I still remember the exact moment in August of 2020. I, a "tech
            lead" just one year out of college, had just received a meeting invite
            to the biweekly software platform tech lead/engineering manager
            meeting. The meeting was filled with Senior and Staff engineers that
            were revolutionizing the computer industry when I was still crawling in my diapers. I was onboarding two engineers
            with extensive industry experience onto my lowly team of one, and my
            manager that I heavily leaned on had
            just left the company. I remember the mixture of excitement and fear
            that hit when I realized, <b>"oh shit, I have no idea what I'm doing"</b>.
          </p>
          <div class="blog-photo-container">

          </div>
          <p>
            Since then, I've rolled up my sleeves and dug in, hitting so many
            "oh shit" obstacles along the way that I've lost track. A
            rollercoaster of a year later, I finally took some time to step out
            of the trenches and see how much progress I've made. The following
            is a nonexhaustive list of lessons I've learned from all the
            mistakes I've made, and ever so occasionally, some of my successes.

            Delegate, even when it's work you don't know how to do
          </h2>
          <p>
            When I first took on the role of tech lead, I struggled to
            efficiently assign tasks to the engineers that were onboarding to my
            team. I mistakenly wanted to make sure I knew how to do a task
            myself before I assigned it to an engineer, because I wanted to be
            able to effectively guide the engineer if they ran into any
            problems. This slowed down our team overall, and frustrated the
            other engineers, as I became a bottleneck and they were unable to
            individually own and drive any part of the system. I quickly killed
            this bad habit after my new manager gave me feedback, saying "your
            unwillingness to give the rest of your teammates hard tasks are
            hindering their ability to grow and learn. As you move higher in
            leadership, you're going to ultimately have to continue giving tasks
            and asking other people to do stuff that you don't know. You have to
            trust them."

          <p>
            One of my rarer successes was creating a team culture where everyone
            felt heard and empowered to bring their ideas to the table. I was
            well aware that even though I had the longest tenure on my team and
            the most context on our engineering systems, I had less working
            experience than many of my teammates. I deliberately made it a point
            to speak last so as not to bias any discussion, solicit feedback on
            my suggested solutions, and pointedly make space for quieter teammates to have their voices heard. This was
            continually called out as one of the best parts of our team in our
            regular anonymous feedback surveys.

            Regularly sync with key stakeholders across the company
          </h2>
          <p>
            One of my biggest mistakes, and one that I still struggle with, is
            syncing with key stakeholders across the company. Sitting down and
            chatting with people across the company has innumerable benefits.
            Other leaders get clarity on work that you're doing and how
            you're impacting the firm, and are able to more easily make key
            decisions with you and your team in mind. At the same time, you get
            to toss ideas off of extremely smart people and learn from their
            experiences. When you finally make decisions and long term plans
            that have been guided by discussions with other stakeholders, you
            inadvertantly bring them onboard as champions of your plan who can
            vouch for you and support you on your endeavors.

            Even with these
            clear benefits, it's hard to remember to do this when you have a
            long list of daily tasks to tackle and the additional friction of
            cold contacting strangers in the company. Moving forward this will
            definitely be an area for me to improve on.

          <h2 class="blog-heading">Protect the team</h2>
          <p>
            When the team was in its infancy, we were filling such a big demand
            at the company that there were so many things to do. On top of that,
            there were constant external forces rocking our team, such as the
            latest big platform migration, the super senior engineer asking us
            to take on tasks, or incident response follow ups that were assigned
            to our team. This nonstop flow of tasks to take on had our team
            running back and forth all the time, and we never had opportunities
            to work on projects that we were responsible for delivering on. At a
            certain point I realized that the buck had to stop somewhere, and it
            was supposed to stop at me. For our team to be effective, I had to
            run intercept, deferring incoming work for later, negotiating stop
            gap solutions, and sometimes just straight up rejecting work that
            was hoisted upon us.

          <h2 class="blog-heading">Be intentional about feedback</h2>
          <p>
            I heavily focused on leveling up the engineers on my team and
            ensuring that they were set up for success. To do that, I needed to provide regular feedback on areas they were
            doing well in and areas in which they had room to grow. However, in
            my regular 1 on 1's, I always struggled to think of anything
            constructive on the spot. Conversely, when I had strong feedback to
            provide, bringing it up always felt incredibly awkward and painful. After several frustrating attempts, I finally found a framework
            that worked for me. I started out every single 1 on 1 by asking for
            feedback from my partner, and providing any feedback that I had.
            Doing so put the expectation of receiving feedback into my
            teammates' minds, making it easier to broach the subject and less of
            a surprise. In addition, every Friday I blocked out a chunk of my
            calendar and dedicated it to reflecting on feedback that I could
            provide my teammates to help them improve.

          <h2 class="blog-heading">Documentation is invaluable to scaling</h2>
          <p>
            The first engineer to join my team was a documentation evangelist,
            and was popularly known for always asking "is this written down
            somewhere?". I didn't truly appreciate the value of documentation
            and his obsession with it until my team started to scale out, adding
            4 new engineers within the time span of a few months. It was
            amazingly efficient to be able to point new engineers to
            documentation that explained historical context, rationale for design
            decisions, and instructions on how to interact with systems. When in
            doubt, write it out!
          </p>
          <hr>
          <p>
            This exercise of reflecting and writing down my progress so far gave
            me a brief moment to appreciate how far I've come.
            At the same time though, I, more than anyone, know how much more
            there still is to learn. Here's to diving back into the trenches and
            searching for the next "oh shit" moment. 💩
