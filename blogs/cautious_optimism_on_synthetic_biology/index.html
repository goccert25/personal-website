                <p>In my last <a href="https://georgetong.dev/blogs/a_primer_on_alternative_protein/index.html"
                        target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> I
                    wrote about the four pillars of alternative protein technology: cultivated meat, precision
                    fermentation, plant based protein, and molecular farming.

                    As I researched more about precision fermentation, I stumbled into its overarching domain of

                    Just last year, BCG released a report assertively titled <a

                        Industry”</a>. As
                    someone focused on tackling climate change, joining or making a company that drives this entire
                    ecosystem forward is incredibly alluring. However, synthetic biology has historically struggled to
                    meet these high expectations, with many companies only <a

                        rel="noopener">delivering a fraction of their promises</a>. The initial synthetic biology boom
                    and bust
                    cycle saw big names like Zymergen and Solazyme wither away and get purchased for a fraction of their
                    evaluation. A question I've frequently been posing to existing players in the space is:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>“Why will
                        this upcoming period of synthetic biology be different? Will it just be another hype cycle with
                        no
                        results to show?”</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some responses that I've received that give me hope:
                </p>
                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Large protein datasets and novel machine learning algorithms have already revolutionized the way
                        protein design (a critical part of synthetic biology) is being performed. Scientists can now
                        provide
                        a series of desired traits for a target protein to a machine learning model and receive multiple
                        promising candidates, significantly reducing the protein search space and R&D time. Technology
                        like
                        this simply didn't exist 5-10 years ago.</li>

                        Increased emphasis on robotics and automation to speed up R&D and improve experiment
                        repeatability.
                        Cloud labs, like Emerald Cloud Labs and <a
                            href="https://www.cmu.edu/mcs/research/cloud-lab/index.html" target="_blank"
                            rel="noopener">CMU's upcoming cloud lab</a>, are slowly gaining traction. Opentrons,
                        developer of lab automation robots, has successfully established a healthy open source ecosystem
                        to
                        accelerate R&D.

                        Laser focus on profitability. Partially due to the macroeconomic environment and partially due
                        to
                        the collapse of previous synthetic biology companies, company finances and business models are
                        under
                        higher scrutiny. Existing and new players are making sure they can generate revenue, usually by
                        targeting pharma with an aim to generalize towards lower margin higher volume products. As a
                        concrete example, <a href="https://www.jellatech.com/" target="_blank"
                            rel="noopener">Jellatech</a> is initially making animal free
                        collagen
                        and gelatin for pharma and R&D applications with a long term focus of targeting food and
                        beverage
                        applications. While there will always be exceptions to the rule, the upcoming slate of companies
                        (and companies that survive the current macroeconomic environment) will be financially
                        sustainable,
                        allowing them to make a long term impact.

                        Declining growth in arable land, more extreme weather, and a growing world population are

                        the stage for food driven humanitarian disasters. Synthetic biology is one tool humans can use
                        to
                        prevent these disasters, whether by genetically engineering crops to be more weather resistant,
                        or

                    For the past few months I've been diving into the underlying science and learning as much as I can
                    with curiosity as my guide and impact as my goal. Maybe this next synthetic biology boom cycle will
                    once again be a bust, but the potential societal benefits are too large to ignore and the tailwinds
                    seem favorable. Time to send it. ⛷️
