      <h1 class="blog-title">Lessons Learned Pivoting into Climate Tech</h1>
      <div class="blog-date">February 15th, 2022</div>
      <div class="blog-body">
        <p><strong>If we spend 1/3rd of our waking life working</strong><strong>, then why not work on something that
            matters?</strong></p>
        <p>This simple question drove me to reevaluate my career and long term vision, convincing me to leave my job at
          Robinhood and dedicate my career to fighting climate change. Finding my next role was harder than expected, so
          I wanted to write down some lessons I learned along the way in case they could be helpful for others.</p>
        <h2 class="blog-heading">Lessons</h2>
        <h3 class="blog-heading-2">Shout from the rooftops!</h3>

        <div class="blog-photo-container">

            Just make sure not to jump </div>
        </div>
        <p>Let everyone know you&rsquo;re interested in fighting climate change. Not only will your announcement
          encourage people on the fence to join the movement, it will also notify your network of your future plans.
          Members of your network that are already tackling climate change will want to reach out and help you along, as
          everyone understands this existential crisis is an all hands on deck moment. As a concrete example, when I
          told a friend I wanted to work on climate change, she instantly connected me to <a
            href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tammytseng/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tammy</a>, a data scientist
          who recently joined <a href="https://watershedclimate.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Watershed</a>.</p>
        <h3 class="blog-heading-2">Have a clear criteria for your next role</h3>
        <p>The climate tech space is big enough that you can grow your career in the way you want while still combating
          climate change. Having clear requirements for your next role significantly reduces your search space and the
          number of suitable opportunities, preventing decision fatigue. Quickly filtering out companies also saves
          everyone time; you won&rsquo;t waste time talking to a company you won&rsquo;t join, and the company
          doesn&rsquo;t waste valuable time it could be spending fighting climate change. Personally, I wanted my next
          role to allow me to stay in the South Bay Area, to be technically challenging, to have a fair work life
          balance, and to have a small high quality team. I ultimately joined <a href="https://endwaste.io/"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glacier</a>, which checked off all those boxes (shameless plug, <a
            href="https://angel.co/company/glacier-2/jobs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we&rsquo;re hiring</a>!).</p>
        <h3 class="blog-heading-2">Join a community!</h3>
        <div class="blog-photo-container">

            Make sure you&rsquo;re in the right flock!</div>
        </div>
        <p>There&rsquo;s a reason why humans are sometimes compared to sheep. The allure of social approval and
          groupthink can drive humans to follow the herd. Take advantage of that internal wiring and join a community so
          the sheep around you naturally influence you to do the right thing. I personally joined <a
            href="https://science.breakthroughenergy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Breakthrough Energy
            Sciences</a> and <a href="https://workonclimate.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Work on Climate</a>,
          both of which are slack communities that welcome climate focused people with open arms. Along with these
          communities came a wealth of resources and extremely intelligent people who were willing to extend a helping
          hand.</p>
        <h3 class="blog-heading-2">Keep an open mind to different solutions</h3>
        <p>Some of the first articles I encountered early in my climate journey led me to believe that agrotech,
          influencing consumer behavior, and crypto were all unfeasible solutions and a waste of resources. It was only
          much later after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OdEqsCtV3w&amp;t=2860s" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener">watching Regrow&rsquo;s tech talk</a>, <a
            href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154621000309" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener">learning that a sizable chunk of greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced via known consumer
            behavior change techniques</a>, and <a
            href="https://climate-investing-book.opensourcestrategies.com/v/main/book/new-technologies" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener">reading Si Chen&rsquo;s exploration of crypto in climate tech</a>, that I realized these are
          all reasonable approaches for taking on climate change. If people are able to take their own interests (such
          as agriculture, social sciences, and crypto) and pursue them while tackling climate change, they should be
          celebrated and encouraged.</p>
        <p>I hope these lessons can help with your transition into climate tech&ndash;we need all the people we can get!
