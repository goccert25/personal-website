            <h1 class="blog-title">Understanding the synthetic biology business and ecosystem</h1>
            <div class="blog-date">November 24th, 2023</div>
            <div class="blog-body">
                <p>As mentioned in my last blog post, I’ve been exploring the synthetic biology space from the
                    perspective of “how do I make technology that can act as a lever to move this ecosystem
                    forward?”. My hunch is that <a target="_blank"
                        href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/synthetic-biology-market"
                        rel="noopener"
                        data-mce-href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/synthetic-biology-market">a
                        space projected to go from 13.09 billion in 2022 to 55.37 billion dollars by 2030</a> will
                    surely need picks and shovels companies to support that kind of growth.</p>
                <p>In this blog post I break down what I understand to be the “traditional” business path a
                    synthetic biology company takes from inception to maturity, the various problems along the way,
                    and existing players that help solve those problems. I use a fictitious company called Mika
                    (named after my dog) that is making bio based fabrics that can replace traditional oil based
                    polyester. Hopefully this article gives a solid high level overview of the ecosystem for the
                    next entrepreneur stepping into the space.</p>
                <h2 class="blog-heading">Target selection and design</h2>
                <p>To start, Mika needs to identify a promising protein that functionally performs better than
                    polyester. In this fictitious scenario, Mika settles on spider silk. However, spider silk also
                    has several (fictitious) downsides: spider silk doesn’t retain color well, can become slimy at
                    high temperatures, and gives off a bad odor.</p>
                <p>Mika uses spider silk as a starting point and begins iterating on the molecular structure to
                    remove these undesirable traits. Historically, scientists work off of intuition built up from
                    past experiences and existing research papers on techniques or modifications that might work.
                    Scientists make a series of educated guesses on modifications, concoct various
                    candidates, create those molecular structures, and test whether the new molecules actually
                    work. This cycle is commonly known as the Design-Build-Test-Learn (DBTL) cycle, and is
                    extremely expensive and time consuming, easily composing a large chunk of the R&amp;D budget.
                    However, with the latest advances in ML for protein design, R&amp;D timelines are
                    going from years to months, as ML models are able to suggest candidates that have a higher
                    likelihood of success.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Existing companies that help with target selection and design typically do so by increasing the
                    speed of a single DBTL iteration (automation) or reducing the number of DBTL cycles necessary
                    (ML for protein design). Companies like <a target="_blank" href="https://automata.tech/"

                <p>Mika is focusing on a protein, but the range of products that can be produced from synthetic
                    biology is huge. For example, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.zeroacre.com/" rel="noopener"
                        data-mce-href="https://www.zeroacre.com/">Zero Acre Farms</a> and <a target="_blank"

                    while <a target="_blank" href="https://www.caprabiosciences.com/" rel="noopener"

                    vitamins.</p>
                <h2 class="blog-heading">Strain engineering</h2>
                <p>After arriving at a modified spider silk that fulfills all target requirements, Mika now needs to
                    figure out how to actually produce the silk. While there are some companies pursuing cell-free
                    manufacturing (most notably <a target="_blank" href="https://solugen.com/" rel="noopener"
                        data-mce-href="https://solugen.com/">Solugen</a>), it is more common to see
                    companies using precision fermentation. In precision fermentation, the instructions to develop
                    your protein of interest are inserted into a specific microbe, also known as a chassis. The
                    microbe is then fed a steady diet of food, allowing it to duplicate while continually producing
                    more of your protein.</p>
                <p>In strain engineering you choose your chassis and then repeatedly modify it to improve its
                    ability to produce your desired protein. Various types of modifications could include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Increasing resilience to foreign bodies: maintaining a perfectly sterile environment is
                        difficult and increased resilience can reduce the risk of a spoiled end product</li>
                    <li>Making the chassis more robust to environmental variation: variables such as pH, temperature,
                        dissolved
                        oxygen content, and amino acid availability can
                        fluctuate inside of a production environment</li>
                    <li>Removing existing metabolic cycles to optimize for target protein production: your chosen
                        chassis could spend 50% of its resources producing your protein and the other 50% of its
                        resources performing other metabolic functions. If other metabolic functions aren’t needed
                        in your controlled production environment, you can genetically modify your chassis to remove
                        them, allowing your chassis to spend more of its resources on producing your protein.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="blog-heading">Bioprocess development</h2>
                <p>Now that Mika has finished developing the protein and creating the microbe to produce the
                    protein, they have to develop the full bioprocess. At a high level, the bioprocess can be broken
                    down into upstream processing, fermentation, and downstream processing.</p>
                <div class='blog-photo-container'>

                <p>During fermentation, the microbe that you genetically engineered to produce your target protein
                    and the food to feed your microbe are placed inside of a special container known as a bioreactor.
                    Upstream processing is everything prior to this step, and downstream processing is everything
                    after this step.</p>
                <p>Developing your upstream process could involve:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Media optimization: figuring out what composition of “food” is best suited for the
                        microbes. E.g. how much glucose, amino acids, oxygen, etc to feed the microbe</li>
                    <li>Media sterilization: developing a process to sterilize the media so that minimal foreign
                        microbes enter the bioreactor</li>
                    <li>Seed train: cells often go through various different stages during their life cycles. Likely
                        only a subset of the stages is optimal for target protein production. Typically the
                        genetically modified chassis is moved between various environments and containers to guide
                        the cells through the different stages until the stage of optimal production, during which
                        it is moved to the final production sized bioreactor. This whole process is known as a seed
                        train</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Several factors also go into the fermentation process:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bioreactor design: there are various types of bioreactors, such as air lifted, stir tanked,
                        and more. All designs have their trade-offs and analysis needs to be done to decide which
                        one is best suited for your chassis and target protein combination</li>
                    <li>Fermentation type: batch, fed batch, continuous, and perfusion fermentation are all
                        different types of fermentation that directly impact bioprocess complexity, capital
                        expenses, and operation expenses. As far as I’m aware, the most commonly chosen type is fed
                        batch</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Downstream processing can get complicated enough to warrant its own dedicated blog post. Some
                    high level ideas of what needs to happen are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Separation: the target protein needs to be separated from the chassis. Depending on your
                        choice of chassis, the target protein could already be external to the cell. Otherwise the
                        cell needs to be lysed (destroyed) to access the target protein</li>
                    <li>Purification: after separation, the target protein is likely still mixed with trace amounts
                        of other media. Depending on the end use, the mixture may need to be further purified</li>
                    <li>Further processing: if the final product needs to be a dry powder, it will need to undergo
                        a drying process. The final product may also be unstable or hard to transport and may need
                        further processing to get it to an acceptable state</li>
                </ul>
                <p>While there are companies that can help develop bioprocesses (see Synthetic biology as a service
                    section for more details), usually most of the bioprocess is developed in-house. Some notable
                    companies relevant to this section are <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newwavebiotech.com/"
                        rel="noopener" data-mce-href="https://www.newwavebiotech.com/">New Wave Biotech</a>, a
                    company focused on downstream process optimization, and <a target="_blank"

                    a company developing continuous fermentation as a service.&nbsp;</p>
                <h2 class="blog-heading">It’s all interdependent</h2>
                <p>I split target selection and design, strain engineering, and bioprocess development into separate
                    categories for simplicity. In reality, a decision in one of these categories impacts decisions
                    in all of the others. For example, one iteration of spider silk might be functionally perfect,
                    but may be incredibly hard to produce in a microbe due to how complex it is. Which chassis to
                    use directly impacts which type of fermentation is feasible and what kind of downstream
                    processing is needed. Synthetic biology companies typically need to go through multiple strain
                    and target selection DBTL iterations all while managing bioprocess development. This immense
                    complexity is one of the reasons why it’s tough to succeed as a synthetic biology company.</p>

                <p>Throughout the whole journey, Mika has to constantly make sure they’re trending towards
                    profitability. Mika can't make money if the selling price for spider silk is less than the cost of
                    developing the
                    spider silk. In order to project and predict costs companies
                    typically perform technoeconomic analyses (TEAs). A few companies/resources that can help with

                <p>As Mika dives deeper into R&amp;D, they start to gather an unmanageable amount of data and
                    employees start to spend more time managing spreadsheets than performing research. To improve
                    employee efficiency, Mika can partner with bio specific data management providers like <a

                <h2 class="blog-heading">Scaling</h2>
                <p>After finally making it through a few years of R&amp;D, Mika has an amazing spider silk, many
                    interested customers, a robust bioprocess, and a microbe that can produce the target product at
                    high rates. Now it’s time to scale!</p>
                <p>At this point Mika has the option of building their own biomanufacturing facility, renting space at
                    an existing biomanufacturing facility, or a combination of both. To help with the decision
                    making, Mika can speak to companies that specialize in helping synthetic biology companies
                    scale, like <a target="_blank" href="https://synonym.bio/" rel="noopener"
                        data-mce-href="https://synonym.bio/">Synonym</a> or <a target="_blank"

                        data-mce-href="https://www.facturegroup.com/">Facture</a>.</p>
                <p>If Mika chooses to rent space at an existing facility, they can approach multiple contract
                    development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs). <a target="_blank"

                        data-mce-href="https://www.biosphere.io/">Biosphere</a> are all companies building their own
                    biomanufacturing capacity with the intention of renting it out. If Mika chooses to build their own
                    facilities, they will need to develop their own plan, find an optimal location, hire contractors,
                    etc, all at a very large upfront capital cost. Alternatively, Mika can look for old existing
                    facilities from adjacent industries that they could retrofit. According to GFI, <a target="_blank"
                        href="https://gfi.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/SCI23024_FERM-manufacturing-capacity-analysis_Final.pdf"
                        rel="noopener"
                        data-mce-href="https://gfi.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/SCI23024_FERM-manufacturing-capacity-analysis_Final.pdf">“where
                        technically feasible, brownfield development and retrofitting equipment have the potential
                        to significantly reduce up-front capital expenditure (CAPEX) by more than 70 percent and
                        shorten construction lead times to six months.”</a></p>
                <p>Note that throughout the scaling process Mika is not finished with R&amp;D. Mika will likely have
                    to take data from various steps in the scale up process and feed it back to the R&amp;D team to
                    further improve the bioprocess. One common problem companies run into as they scale is their
                    microbe producing their target product at lower rates as the size of their bioreactor increases.
                    This
                    decrease in efficiency directly impacts the bottom line.</p>

                <p>Looking at everything that needs to be done to build a successful synthetic biology company can
                    be daunting. Some companies claim to simplify this endeavor by providing a full end to end
                    service that can help from idea inception all the way to scale up. <a target="_blank"

                    all companies that fall into this “synthetic biology as a service” category.</p>
                <h2 class="blog-heading">There are problems opportunities everywhere</h2>
                <p>Hopefully this article gives the reader a better sense of the types of problems that synthetic
                    biology companies run into as well as how the business works. There are plenty of problems to
                    tackle when building a synthetic biology company which also means there’s plenty of opportunity
                    for B2B innovators to improve the ecosystem as a whole.</p>
                <p>For brevity and simplicity, this article skiped over many additional aspects of the business.
                    Additionally this article only covers what I personally view as a “traditional” synthetic
                    biology company. There are plenty of other super cool companies that don’t fit into this
                    paradigm like:</p>
